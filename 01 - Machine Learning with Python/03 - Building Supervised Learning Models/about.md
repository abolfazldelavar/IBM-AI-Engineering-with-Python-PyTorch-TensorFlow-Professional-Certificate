In this module, you will build and evaluate a range of supervised machine learning models to solve both classification and regression problems. You’ll start by describing how classification models predict categorical outcomes, and implement multi-class classification strategies using real-world data. You’ll then explore how decision trees make predictions and apply them to both classification and regression tasks. The module also covers using support vector machines (SVM) for fraud detection, applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for customer classification, and training ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost to improve accuracy and efficiency. You’ll differentiate bias and variance in model performance and explore how ensemble methods help balance this tradeoff. To support your learning, you’ll receive a Cheat Sheet: Building Supervised Learning Models with key terms, model types, and evaluation tips.
