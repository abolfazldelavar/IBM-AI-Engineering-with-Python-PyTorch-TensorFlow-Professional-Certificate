00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.260
Welcome to Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Ecosystem.

2
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.779
After watching this video, you will be able to describe the machine learning ecosystem.

3
00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:22.100
You will also be able to explain the features of the scikit-Learn library and how it works.

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.540
Imagine you developed a music streaming app that allows users to play and download music,

5
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.340
share music files, and create playlists.

6
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.939
To increase your app's user base, you collect information on your users' listening habits,

7
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:38.659
such as what songs they play, how long they listen to songs, and which songs they skip.

8
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.380
Once you've collected the information, you want to normalize it by finding inconsistent

9
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.659
data, missing values, and outliers.

10
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.540
Machine learning tools can generate this type of information.

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.180
They are useful for data collection, preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model deployment,

12
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.740
and monitoring.

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.139
The machine learning, or ML ecosystem, refers to the interconnected tools, frameworks, libraries,

14
00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:08.580
platforms, and processes that support developing, deploying, and managing machine learning models.

15
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
Python offers a wide variety of tools and libraries for machine learning.

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.819
Several open-sourced Python libraries comprise one of the most widely used ecosystems for

17
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.139
machine learning.

18
00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:23.220
NumPy provides foundational machine learning support with its efficient numerical computations

19
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.779
on large multidimensional data arrays.

20
00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:32.019
Pandas, built on NumPy and Matplotlib, is used for data analysis, visualization, cleaning,

21
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.900
and preparing data for machine learning.

22
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.900
Pandas uses versatile arrays called data frames to handle data.

23
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.180
SciPy, built on NumPy, is used for scientific computing and has modules for optimization,

24
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.900
integration, linear regression, and more.

25
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.580
Matplotlib is built on NumPy and has an extensive, highly customizable set of visualization tools.

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.059
Scikit-learn, built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, is used for building classical machine learning

27
00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:58.059
models.

28
00:01:58.059 --> 00:02:01.180
Let's take a closer look at scikit-learn.

29
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.059
Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for the Python programming language.

30
00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:11.059
It has a wide, up-to-date selection of classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality

31
00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.380
reduction algorithms.

32
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.139
It's designed to work with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

33
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.419
It has excellent documentation and a large community support network.

34
00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:27.259
Scikit-learn is constantly evolving with contributions from a community of thousands and is exceeded

35
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.139
only by Pandas.

36
00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.779
Implementing machine learning models with scikit-learn is easy, with just a few lines

37
00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.619
of Python code.

38
00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.300
Most of the tasks that need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are already implemented

39
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.740
in scikit-learn, including data preprocessing tasks like data cleaning, scaling, feature

40
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.580
selection and feature extraction, train or test splitting, model setup and fitting, hyperparameter

41
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.619
tuning with cross-validation, prediction, evaluation, and exporting the model to be

42
00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:55.619
used in production.

43
00:02:55.619 --> 00:03:01.460
Here's an example of a basic machine learning workflow using the scikit-learn library.

44
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.259
Consider a data set X and a target variable Y, both stored as NumPy arrays.

45
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.500
Scikit-learn's pre-processing package provides several common utility functions and transformer

46
00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
classes to help you prepare data for modeling.

47
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:19.139
For instance, this first code block scales your data by standardizing it.

48
00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.679
In supervised learning, you want to split your data set into train and test sets to train

49
00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.220
your model and then test the model's accuracy separately.

50
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.259
Scikit-learn can split arrays and matrices into random train and test subsets for you

51
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.860
in one line of code.

52
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.460
Here, 33% of the data is reserved for testing.

53
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.259
Next, you can instantiate a classifier model using a support vector classification algorithm.

54
00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.300
This line of code generates a classification model object, called clf, and initializes

55
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.940
its parameters, gamma and C.

56
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.619
After initializing your model clf, you can train your model on the training data.

57
00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:58.339
The clf model learns to predict the classes for unknown cases by passing the training

58
00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.539
set to the fit method.

59
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.160
Then you can use the test data to generate predictions.

60
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.300
The result tells you the predicted class for each observation in the test set.

61
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.800
You can also use different metrics to evaluate your model accuracy, such as a confusion matrix

62
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.239
to compare the predicted and actual labels for the test set.

63
00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.480
And finally, you can save your model as a pickle file and retrieve it whenever you like.

64
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.160
In this video, you have learned that a machine learning ecosystem refers to the interconnected

65
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.540
tools, frameworks, libraries, platforms, and processes that support developing, deploying,

66
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.739
and managing machine learning models.

67
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:41.179
It uses several Python tools and libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib,

68
00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:42.179
and scikit-learn.

69
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:48.140
Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python that uses classification, regression,

70
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.579
clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

71
00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.459
Most tests required in a machine learning pipeline are already implemented in scikit-learn.

72
00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:00.540
Finally, you learned the basic machine learning workflow using the scikit-learn library.
