    "# 📘 Understanding Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** is a method for estimating the coefficients of a linear regression model.  \n",
    "It finds the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y$: dependent (output) variable  \n",
    "- $x$: independent (input) variable  \n",
    "- $\\beta_0$: intercept  \n",
    "- $\\beta_1$: slope (coefficient)  \n",
    "- $\\epsilon$: error term (difference between prediction and observation)\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS minimizes the **sum of squared residuals**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i$ is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize $S$.\n",

    "### For Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have multiple predictors (features), the model can be written in matrix form as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n",

    "\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where  \n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$: matrix of input variables (with a column of 1s for the intercept)  \n",
    "- $\\mathbf{y}$: vector of outputs  \n",

    "## 4. Why It's Called \"Least Squares\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The method **minimizes the sum of squared residuals**, i.e., it chooses the line where the total squared error between predictions and actual data is the smallest possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Limitations of OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS works well under the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. Linearity between inputs and outputs.  \n",
    "2. Errors are independent and normally distributed.  \n",
    "3. Constant variance of errors (homoscedasticity).  \n",
    "4. No multicollinearity among predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, OLS struggles when:\n",
    "- The relationship is **nonlinear**.  \n",
    "- There are **outliers** (since squaring residuals amplifies large errors).  \n",
    "- Predictors are **highly correlated** (multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Multicollinearity Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity** occurs when two or more independent variables are **highly correlated**, meaning they contain overlapping information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_2 \\approx 2x_1$, then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are nearly linearly dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS computes coefficients via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If predictors are correlated, $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ becomes **nearly singular** (non-invertible).  \n",
    "This causes numerical instability, making the coefficient e\n"
