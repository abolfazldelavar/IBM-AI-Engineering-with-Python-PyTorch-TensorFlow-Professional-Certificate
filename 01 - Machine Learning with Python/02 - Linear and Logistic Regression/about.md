In this module, you will explore two essential regression techniques used in machine learning—linear and logistic regression. You’ll explain the role of regression in predicting outcomes, describe the differences between simple and multiple linear regression, and apply both using scikit-learn on real-world data. You will also interpret how polynomial and non-linear regression models capture complex patterns. The module introduces logistic regression as a classification method and guides you in training and testing classification models effectively. To support your learning, you’ll receive a Cheat Sheet: Linear and Logistic Regression that summarizes key concepts, formulas, and use cases.
