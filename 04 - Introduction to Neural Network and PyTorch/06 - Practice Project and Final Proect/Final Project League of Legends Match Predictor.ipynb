    "- Save the model's learned weights and biases using torch.save().( e.g. , torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'your_model_name.pth'))\n",

    "- Create a new model instance (e.g., `model = LogisticRegressionModel()`) and load the saved parameters. ( e.g. , `model.load_state_dict(torch.load('your_model_name.pth'))`)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluating the Loaded Model:\n",
    "   - After loading, set the model to evaluation mode by calling `model.eval()\n",
    "   - After loading the model, evaluate it again on the test dataset to make sure it performs similarly to when it was first trained..Now evaluate it on the test data.\n",

    "The code to evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.\n",

    " 1.Extracting Model Weights:\n",

    " - You can extract the weights using `model.linear.weight.data.numpy()` and flatten the resulting tensor to get a 1D array of feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Creating a DataFrame:\n",
    " - Create a pandas DataFrame with two columns: one for the feature names and the other for their corresponding importance values (i.e., the learned weights).\n",
    " - Ensure the features are aligned with their names in your dataset (e.g., `X_train.columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorting and Plotting Feature Importance:\n",
    "  - Sort the features based on the absolute value of their importance (weights) to identify the most impactful features.\n",
